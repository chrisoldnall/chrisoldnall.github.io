As someone who is very passionate about helping local charities and getting involved in the community, I decided to undertake the role of Member Pioneer for Edinburgh Central with The Coop, having been in a similar post from August 2020 - July 2021 in York East. In this role I work with stores and causes in the area to ensure the Coop is giving the most it can back to the community.
