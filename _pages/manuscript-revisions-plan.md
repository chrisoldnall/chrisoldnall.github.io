# Manuscript Revisions Plan

This page outlines the detailed workflow plan for completing the manuscript revisions between **23rd December 2023** and **3rd January 2024**. The plan is divided into daily tasks to ensure progress is systematic and all reviewer feedback is addressed.

---

## **Workflow Plan**

### **23rd December**
- Review reviewer feedback to familiarise yourself with comments.
- Organise paper sections into areas needing revisions.
- Draft a rebuttal template with placeholders for each comment.

### **24th December**
- Standardise SNP selection methods across PBMC and UKB datasets.
- Investigate and document sample size discrepancies (862 PBMC vs 1,068 MS runs).
- Add clarifications to the Methods section (Section 4.1).

### **26th December**
- Define key terms like "isoform-specific proteins," "protein group," and "modification-specific peptides."
- Create a table/figure to visually explain terms.
- Ensure consistent terminology in Sections 2.1, 4.1, and captions.

### **27th December**
- Justify use of self-reported outcomes in Section 4.4.
- Expand on how HEIDI outlier analysis identifies pleiotropy (Section 4.6).
- Add discussion on MR assumptions in Section 3, including single-SNP limitations and pleiotropy challenges.

### **28th December**
- Prepare a table comparing GS and UKB cohort demographics (Section 4.1).
- Justify the focus on UKB proteins for enrichment analyses (Section 4.7).
- If feasible, conduct enrichment analyses for GS proteins.

### **29th December**
- Clarify lead SNP selection criteria in Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1.
- Expand discussion of COMT and SWAP70 discordant effects.
- Address inconsistencies in protein association numbers (127 vs 165 proteins).

### **30th December**
- Add histograms or numerical summaries for sample sizes (Section 4.1.8).
- Create supplementary tables for all tested proteins with significance.
- Include genome reference details for BP coordinates.

### **31st December**
- Add a detailed study limitations subsection in Section 3.
- Refine overarching conclusions in the Discussion.

### **1st January**
- Ensure all main figures are converted to .tif or .eps format.
- Remove logos or branding from Figures 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Draft detailed point-by-point rebuttal letter addressing reviewer comments.

### **2nd January**
- Conduct a full review of the manuscript, ensuring consistency and clarity.
- Check all journal-specific requirements (e.g., formatting, funding statements).
- Make final updates to the rebuttal letter.

### **3rd January**
- Generate clean and track-changes versions of the manuscript.
- Prepare supplementary materials and ensure compliance with journal guidelines.
- Submit the revised manuscript and rebuttal letter.
