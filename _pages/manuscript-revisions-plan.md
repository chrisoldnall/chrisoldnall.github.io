## **Reviewer Points**

### **Major Points**
1. Justification for PBMC Inclusion: The manuscript lacks a strong justification for including cellular proteome data from PBMCs in a study focused on CVD, especially given the relevance of plasma proteomics for this context.
2. Sample Size and Statistical Power: The PBMC cohort (N = 862) is significantly smaller than the UKB plasma proteomics dataset, limiting statistical power. The reliance on single SNP instruments in PBMC analyses further weakens causal inference compared to plasma proteomics, which utilised multiple SNP instruments.
3. Inconsistent Methodologies: The selection criteria for genetic instruments differ between PBMC and UKB datasets:
    - PBMC analysis used only cis-SNPs without multiple testing correction.
    - UKB data applied Bonferroni correction and multiple SNPs. This inconsistency should either be justified or re-performed with consistent methods.
4. Opposing Effects of COMT and SWAP70: Proteins like COMT and SWAP70 showed opposing effects in PBMC and plasma data. While methodological explanations are provided, the discussion should explore potential biological reasons, such as tissue-specific protein functions.
5. Sample Overlap and Bias: Both plasma proteomics and CVD GWAS datasets are derived from UKB, which could introduce biases due to overlapping samples. Sensitivity analyses (e.g., splitting datasets into non-overlapping subsets or using independent datasets for CVD GWAS) are needed to quantify and address potential bias.
6. Insufficient Information on Genetic Instrument Selection:
    - Missing details on LD \( r^2 \), p-value thresholds, and allele frequency differences used in instrument selection.
    - Lack of clarity about when and how clumping was performed, including thresholds used.
7. HEIDI Outlier Filtering: The threshold used for identifying and excluding horizontally pleiotropic SNPs in HEIDI filtering was not reported.
8. Limitations of the Study: The discussion should explicitly address study limitations, including:
    - Potential biases from reliance on affinity-based and MS-based assays.
    - Challenges interpreting protein abundance in the context of genetic variation.
9. Additional MR Methods: Incorporating alternative MR methods (e.g., IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median, RAPS, MR-PRESSO) could address potential pleiotropy and validate the robustness of results.
10. Clarity on Terminology: Key terms (e.g., peptide, isoform, protein group, peptide-specific protein, modification-specific peptide) are inconsistently used and not adequately defined. Consistent definitions and possibly a figure illustrating these concepts would help.

### **Minor Points**
1. Relevance of PBMC Data: Expand the discussion on the relevance of immune cells (PBMCs) to CVD traits and potential unique insights they might offer compared to plasma proteomics.
2. Contradictory Statistics: Clarify inconsistencies, such as the number of proteins reduced from 127 to 165 after filtering for cis-pQTLs.
3. Effect Sizes in Table 1: Include effect sizes from GSMR analyses to provide a clearer understanding of the direction and magnitude of effects.
4. Sample Size Discrepancies: Explain discrepancies in sample sizes (e.g., 861 samples analysed by MS vs. 736 individuals included in GWAS).
5. Choice of Outcomes: Justify the use of self-reported CVD outcomes in UKB instead of ICD codes.
6. Excluded SNP Counts: Explain why proteins with 0, 2, or 4 SNPs were excluded from analysis.
7. Supplementary Data:
    - Provide a supplementary table listing all protein groups in GS, not just significant ones.
    - Include genome reference information for BP coordinates in supplementary tables.
8. Clumping Process: Clarify when clumping was performed, for which cohorts, and the methodology used.
