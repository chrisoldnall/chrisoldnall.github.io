# Manuscript Revisions Plan

This page outlines the detailed workflow plan for completing the manuscript revisions between **23rd December 2023** and **3rd January 2024**. Each day is divided into tasks and expected outputs to ensure all reviewer feedback is addressed systematically. Reviewer points are listed at the bottom of the page for reference, with task numbers linked to these points.

## **Workflow Plan**

### **23rd December**
#### **Tasks**
1. Review reviewer feedback to familiarise yourself with comments. *(Reviewer Point #1)*
2. Organise paper sections into areas needing revisions. *(Reviewer Point #1)*
3. Draft a rebuttal template with placeholders for each comment. *(Reviewer Point #1)*
#### **Output**
- Rebuttal template.
- Organised task tracking document.

---

### **24th December**
#### **Tasks**
4. Standardise SNP selection methods across PBMC and UKB datasets. *(Reviewer Point #2)*
5. Investigate and document sample size discrepancies (862 PBMC vs 1,068 MS runs). *(Reviewer Point #6)*
6. Add clarifications to the Methods section (Section 4.1). *(Reviewer Points #2, #6)*
#### **Output**
- Updated Methods section.
- Supplementary note or table clarifying SNP selection.

---

### **26th December**
#### **Tasks**
7. Define key terms like "isoform-specific proteins," "protein group," and "modification-specific peptides." *(Reviewer Point #3)*
8. Create a table/figure to visually explain terms. *(Reviewer Point #3)*
9. Ensure consistent terminology in Sections 2.1, 4.1, and captions. *(Reviewer Point #10)*
#### **Output**
- Glossary in the Methods section.
- Terminology table or figure.

---

### **27th December**
#### **Tasks**
10. Justify use of self-reported outcomes in Section 4.4. *(Reviewer Point #8)*
11. Expand on how HEIDI outlier analysis identifies pleiotropy (Section 4.6). *(Reviewer Point #4)*
12. Add discussion on MR assumptions in Section 3, including single-SNP limitations and pleiotropy challenges. *(Reviewer Points #4, #3)*
#### **Output**
- Revised Methods section.
- Expanded Discussion section addressing MR assumptions.

---

### **28th December**
#### **Tasks**
13. Prepare a table comparing GS and UKB cohort demographics (Section 4.1). *(Reviewer Point #5)*
14. Justify the focus on UKB proteins for enrichment analyses (Section 4.7). *(Reviewer Point #16)*
15. If feasible, conduct enrichment analyses for GS proteins. *(Reviewer Point #16)*
#### **Output**
- Cohort demographics comparison table.
- Supplementary enrichment results (if applicable).

### **29th December**
#### **Tasks**
16. Clarify lead SNP selection criteria in Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1. *(Reviewer Point #6)*
17. Expand discussion of COMT and SWAP70 discordant effects. *(Reviewer Point #12)*
