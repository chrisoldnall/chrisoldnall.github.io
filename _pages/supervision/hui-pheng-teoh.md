### Identifying and explaining key trends in Scottish accident and emergency attendances and waiting times.
Accident and emergency (A&E) attendances and waiting times have been the focus
of media attention in recent years. Prolonged A&E waiting times can have detrimental
effects on patient outcomes. This dissertation explores key trends in Scottish A&E
activity and investigates the influence of patient demographics, time and location on
A&E attendances and waiting times. The insights gained may contribute to A&E
service improvements by highlighting areas of high demand and poor performance.
Line graphs, heat maps and choropleth maps were created to illustrate data trends,
and a generalised linear model (GLM) based on Poisson regression was built for
forecasting purposes to guide planning and service development. Differences were
observed in A&E attendance volumes depending on department type (emergency
department or minor injuries unit) and health board. After accounting for population
size, Scottish health boards were found to have similar A&E attendance rates.
Comparisons between 2012 and 2022 data revealed that all Scottish health boards
had recorded a decrease in the percentage of patients seen within 4 hours, despite
reductions in attendance rates in most health boards during this period. A&E
attendances were highest in March through to August, with variations in periods of
high service demand (time of the day and day of the week) depending on department
type. The GLM results aligned with previous findings regarding the direct relationship
between deprivation and the number of A&E attendances, and observations of higher
attendances in patients over 75 years of age. The dissertation successfully created a
model to predict future A&E attendances and lays the foundation upon which future
models can be refined and built upon. This research has provided some key insights
into A&E activity. It has also revealed that the relationship between A&E attendance
numbers, waiting times, arrival hour, patient demographics and location is complex
and is influenced by additional factors not encapsulated by this dissertation.
