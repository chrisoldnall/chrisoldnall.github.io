### Identifying and explaining key trends in Scottish accident and emergency attendances and waiting times.
The analysis of A&E data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of healthcare utilisation, resource allocation, and patient outcomes. By examining comprehensive and longitudinal datasets, Hui's research project aims to identify and explore key trends in accident and emergency (A&E) activity data within Scotland. Moreover, it aims to explore the factors influencing these trends and provide explanations for the observed variations. Using a combination of statistical analysis, data visualisation, and qualitative exploration, the research will delve into the relationships between A&E activity and various demographic, geographic, and temporal factors. This includes investigating the impact of population demographics, socio- economic factors, and urbanisation on A&E utilisation rates.
