### Uncovering key drivers of optimal and sub-optimal blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes.
OpenAPS was developed by a dedicated community of individuals, named #wearenotwaiting, who sought to provide a more flexible and customisable approach to diabetes management. The data is generated by patients on insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) which communicate with each other by means of an algorithm â€“ people however on these systems still need to administer insulin with their food and make adjustments with exercise; the data collected includes glucose concentrations (recorded every 5 minutes) insulin dose, activity and food / carbohydrate intake. George's project looks to extract and anlyse data from these complex datasets and apply statistical and machine learning techniques in order to understand factors that lead to excellent as well as suboptimal blood glucose control.
