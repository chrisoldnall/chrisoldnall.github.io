Throughout my life, I have always had a passion for volunteering. Therefore, after moving to Edinburgh, it made sense to try and combine this with my working in programming. Currently I volunteer with three different organisations: The Royal Statistical Society, CodeBar and PreWired.

Royal Statistical Society (RSS), Edinburgh Local Group
======
The [RSS](https://rss.org.uk) have a variety of local and special interest groups. One of which is based in [Edinburgh](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/groups/edinburgh/). For the last two years I have been involved in the local group helping to arrange and plan a range of statistically related events:

- 2022-2023: Secretary
- 2021-2022: Ordinary Member

CodeBar
======
[CodeBar](https://codebar.io) is a global intiative to enable minority group members to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this they run free regular workshops, regular one-off events and try to create opportunities for students - all in an effort to making technology and coding more accessible. I regularly attend the Edinburgh group events as a coach, aiming to share my skills and encourage everyone to get involved.

PreWired
======
[Prewired](https://www.prewired.org) is a programming club for those based in Edinburgh (and surrounding areas) who are under 19. It provides a safe space for those who are interested in learning to code, or already know how and want to go even further.
