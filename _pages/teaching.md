Currently within the University of Edinburgh, I am employed to teach across all three colleges in the univeristy: The College of Science and Engineering (CSE), The College of Medicine and Vetinary Medicine (CMVM), and The College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS). The level of involvement and delivery varies between locations and so below I list my teaching experience so far.

2023-2024
=============

School of Mathematics, CSE
-------------
For this academic year I tutored on the following courses:
- Statistical Methodology (Y3/4)
- Regression and Simulation Methods (SMSTC)
- Applied Statistics (Y3/4)
- Linear Modelling, Programming and Solution (Y3/4)
- Statistical Research Skills (MSc)

The Medical School, CMVM
-------------
This year I will again be working in the Edinburgh Medical School on the MBChB programme, within the component "Research and Evidence Based Medicine":
- Year 1 (Semester 2 Only)
- Year 2 (Semester 1 and 2)

The Usher Institute, CMVM
-------------
Within the Usher Institute this year, I assisted in both the masters programme and also with some undergraduate teaching.

### Undergraduate.
I was the teaching assistant on the module, **"Data Science for Health and Biomedical Sciences."** This module, which is typically taken in Y3/4 of an undergraduate, primarily looks to give students from across the college a developed ability to programme in R and understand the further uses of data science in the field.

### MSc in Data Science for Health and Social Care.
In Semester 1, I was the lead tutor on the module, **"Introduction to Data Science in Health and Social Care."** In Semester 2, I was the co-course organiser for the module **"Introduction to Statistics for Health and Social Care."**

Centre for Data, Culture and Society (CDCS), CAHSS
-------------
As a teaching fellow in the CDCS I will be creating, developing and delivering a range of courses in conjunction with my colleagues. These are all courses made to be accessible to those working in arts, humanities and social sciences, and all include an element of programming. So far this includes:

- Introduction to Python Programming
- Introduction to R and RStudio
- Introduction to Statistics

2022-2023
=============

School of Mathematics, CSE 
-------------
In the 2022-2023 year I was involved in a variety of course across probability, statistics, operational research and applied and computational mathematics. These were:

- Probability (Y2)
- Statistics (Y2)
- Statistical Methodology (Y3/4)
- Linear Programming, Modelling and Solution (Y3/4)
- Incomplete Data Analysis (MSc)
- Statistical Research Skills (MSc)
- Regression and Simulation Methods (SMSTC)

Cover work for: Several Variable Calculus and Differential Equations, Fundamentals of Optimisation.

The Medical School, CMVM 
-------------
For 2022-2023, I also began teaching within the school of medicine the module "Research and Evidence Based Medicine (REBM)." This module introduces medical students to the concept of critical thinking when reviewing papers, as well as several statistical concepts and programming in R.

The Usher Institute, CMVM
-------------
Within The Usher Institute, there is a part-time 3 year masters programme, "Data Science for Health and Social Care." As part of this programme, I assisted in tutoring on the following modules:

- Introduction to Statistics
- Data Types and Data Structures in R and Python
